# Email Filtering and Querying  

This project was conducted in the spring semester 2019 for the master course of Web information retrieval
and data mining -  2IMM15 at TU/e. You can view the demo presentation of the application on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xcqqoetBsk&feature=youtu.be), take a look on the [Report](documentation/IRDM%20project%20report%20git.pdf) or preview the [Project Poster](documentation/poster.pdf).

## Overview

<p align="center"><img src="documentation/Screenshot%20classifier.png" width=550 align=center/></p>

Choosing an efficient way to query email data, distinguish spam mail from a users mailbox, clustering emails into subject categories 
are all tasks and challenges an email provider is responsible for in order to serve the end user successfully.
Using Information Retrieval and Data Mining techniques I worked as a part of a group on building the functionality of 
an email provider and testing it on a large email dataset. The code presented is my part of the assignment on Boolean IR querying and email Classification.
